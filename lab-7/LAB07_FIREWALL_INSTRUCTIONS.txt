==================================================
  Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) Instructions
==================================================
1. To build the kernel objec (.ko) file
   $ make args="<filename_w/o_.c>"
   Example: $ make args="hello" for file "hello.c"

2. To install the compiled .ko file
   $ sudo insmod <filename>.ko
   Example: $ sudo insmod hello.ko

3. To remove the installed .ko file
   $ sudo rmmod <filename>.ko
   Example: $ sudo rmmod hello.ko

4. To view the result
   $ tail /var/log/syslog

5. (Optional) Install missing packages if errors displayed
   $ su -- seedubuntu   // Root credentials
   $ apt-get install manpages-dev manpages-posix manpages-posix-dev 


TO. (Not turn in) Compile and install "dropAllPackets.ko" into the kernel.
    Verify whether you have access to the internet by "ping www.towson.edu"

TURN-IN TASKS
=================================
+ TASK 01: Complete "dropUdpPackets.c" to drop only UDP packets
  Hints:
    + You will need to extract the struct iphdr (IP header) and take a look at the protocol inside the header.      
    + Directions:
    - Get iphdr from sb_buff as a pointer.
    - Typecast idphdr to either tcphdr or udphdr pointer based on the "protocal" field of iphdr.
      Note: Make use of the ihl (ip header length) in iphdr.
    - Get the protocol and compare that to UDP protocol (what number was that?).
      If protocol is UDP, drop packets.
      If not, accept packets.

+ TASK 02: Complete "dropWebPackets.c" to drop only WEB packets (i.e., allow ping, telnet traffic, etc).
  Hints:
    + You will need to extract the port from the struct iphdr (IP header).
      However, this structure does not contain the source port.
    + There are two other sub-structures of "iph", namely "tcph" and "udph" inside iph that can contain the source port.
    + Directions:
    - Get iphdr from sb_buff as a pointer.
    - Typecast idphdr to either tcphdr or udphdr pointer based on the "protocal" field of iphdr.
      Note: Make use of the ihl (ip header length) in iphdr.
    - Get the source port from either tcphdr or udphdr and compare that to 80.
      If port is 80, drop packets
      If not, accept packets.
